We have an application that has movies and people will search them, find info about them.
But the first use case has to do with the user logging in the app, having the ability to like/dislike a movie and add them in a "watch later" list
How to do the uml sequence diagram.

In this sequence diagram:

1.The user sends a login request to the application.
2.The application processes the login request and sends a login response back to the user.
3.The user requests movie details from the application.
4.The application retrieves the movie details from the database and sends them back to the user.
5.The user likes or dislikes a movie.
6.The user's action is sent to the application.
7.The application updates the likes/dislikes for the movie in the database and sends an update response back to the user.
8.The user adds a movie to the "watch later" list.
9.The user's action is sent to the application.
10.The application updates the user's "watch later" list in the database and sends an update response back to the user.
Please note that this is a simplified representation, and there may be additional steps and interactions depending on the specific implementation of your application.
